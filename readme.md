# Web Dev Jeopardy by Morgan Murrah - v7.0 - 2025 Career Update Edition!

This game started as one of my first ever web projects in 2016 and was my first application of HTML, CSS, Javsacript and JQuery. This was my beginning. 

### Current Game:

A trimmed down and spruced up version of the game to celebrate 8 years in the industry.
